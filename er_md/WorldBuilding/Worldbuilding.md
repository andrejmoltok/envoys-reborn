1. **Size of the World**: Consider the scale and size of your world based on the scope of your RPG. Determine if you want a small, contained area or a vast continent. Think about the number of locations, cities, and points of interest you want to include. Keep in mind that a larger world may require more development effort.
    
2. **Terrain and Relief**: Create diverse terrains and relief features such as mountains, hills, plains, forests, deserts, and bodies of water. Think about how these features interact with each other and influence climate patterns. Mountains, for example, can create rain shadows, affecting the distribution of rainfall and creating different climate zones.
    
3. **Climates and Biomes**: Determine the general climate zones for your world, such as temperate, tropical, arid, or polar regions. Research real-world climate patterns and understand how factors like latitude, elevation, ocean currents, and prevailing winds impact climate. Assign different biomes to different regions based on their climate characteristics, such as forests, grasslands, tundras, or deserts.
    
4. **Weather Patterns**: Consider the impact of weather patterns on different regions. Coastal areas may experience more rainfall and humidity due to oceanic influences, while inland areas may have more extreme temperature variations. Incorporate elements like seasonal changes, prevailing winds, and weather phenomena to add depth and realism to your world.
    
5. **Geographic Features and Climate Interactions**: Analyze how different geographic features influence climate. Mountains can create rain shadows, resulting in dry regions on one side and wet regions on the other. Large bodies of water can moderate temperatures, creating milder climates along coastlines. Use these interactions to determine the distribution of different climates and biomes within your world.
    
6. **Mapping Tools and Resources**: Utilize mapping tools and resources to assist you in visualizing and creating the geography of your world. Online map generators or GIS software can help you create landmasses, draw coastlines, and add terrain features. You can also find inspiration from real-world maps, fantasy maps, or resources like the Azgaar's Fantasy Map Generator.
    
7. **Consistency and Internal Logic**: Ensure that the geography and climate of your world are internally consistent. Consider how different regions interact with each other and maintain logical connections. Avoid abrupt transitions between vastly different climates or unrealistic geographical features unless you have a specific narrative or magical explanation for it.
    
8. **Iterate and Refine**: Don't be afraid to iterate and refine your world's geography. Seek feedback from others, such as fellow RPG enthusiasts or playtesters, to gather different perspectives and identify areas for improvement. Continuously update and refine the geography as your world-building process evolves.
