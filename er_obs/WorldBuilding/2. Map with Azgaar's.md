Creating a hidden portal to other universes in the middle of the planet, surrounded by high mountains, is a fantastic idea! It adds an element of mystery and exclusivity to the central location. The notion that only a few who prove themselves worthy can access this place adds a layer of challenge and significance to the portal.

1. **Geography:**
    
    - Visualize the high mountains surrounding the hidden portal. Consider the terrain, elevation changes, and the overall shape of the landscape. The mountains can serve as a natural barrier, enhancing the secrecy of the portal.
2. **Location of the Portal:**
    
    - Determine the precise location of the hidden portal. Is it at the summit of the highest mountain, within a cave, or perhaps nestled in a secluded valley? The specific placement can influence the difficulty of reaching it.
3. **Terrain Features:**
    
    - Explore other terrain features around the portal. Are there forests, rivers, or unique geological formations? These elements can add richness to the surroundings and provide potential quest locations.
4. **Worthy Access:**
    
    - Define what it means to be "worthy" to access the portal. Are there trials, challenges, or tests that characters must undergo? This can become a central part of the game's lore and quests.
5. **Surrounding Areas:**
    
    - Consider what lies beyond the high mountains. Are there settlements, ancient ruins, or mystical landmarks in the vicinity? These areas can become points of interest for players exploring the world.
6. **Map Legend:**
    
    - Use a legend to denote key features on your map. Clearly mark the location of the hidden portal and any significant landmarks. This makes the map more accessible for players and enhances their understanding of the world.
7. **Additional Universes:**
    
    - If characters access other universes through the portal, you might want to plan a few of these universes. Each could have unique characteristics, challenges, and opportunities for exploration.
